## Prerequisites

Make sure you have **Python 3.7, 3.8, 3.9**, and the **latest version of VS Code** installed.

NOTE: there's no preference on how to manage different Python versions. I personally use [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv), others may use [Conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/). What's important is that the above three Python versions have all been installed.

Important: During development, make sure you:
- **Don't** install Cyberbrain from PyPI
- **Don't** install the Cyberbrain VS Code extension

## Install Dependencies

Cyberbrain consists of a Python package, and a VS Code extension. We have to install dependencies for both.

### Install dependencies for the Python library
  
   We use [PDM](https://pdm.fming.dev/) to manage dependencies. Assuming you've installed PDM and set it up correctly, run:
   ```
   pdm install
   ```
Make sure the default Python version (i.e. the version when you run "python") matches with what's used in VS Code.

### Install dependencies for VS Code

   Make sure you have **[Node.js 14.16.0](https://nodejs.org/ko/blog/release/v14.16.0/)** and npm installed. There's no guarantee that other versions will work.

   Then `npm install` inside the `cyberbrain-vsc` folder.

## Run Tests

After installing dependencies, you always want to run the tests to make sure everything works correctly.

### Run Python Tests

In the project root directory. If you're busy coding, use:

```
pdm run pytest --assert=plain
```

When you're done with development, make sure to test against all supported Python versions by running:

```
pdm run tox
```

### Run JavaScript Tests

```
cd cyberbrain-vsc && npm run unittest
```

### Run End-to-End Tests in VS Code

There are two ways to run the e2e tests.

- From VS Code's UI (recommended)

  1. **Make sure `cyberbrain-vsc` is opened as a top-level folder in VS Code**. If you opened the root directory `Cyberbrain`, though `cyberbrain-vsc` is included, it will NOT work.

  2. You should then see the two options ("Run Extension" and "Extension Tests") show up in the Run view. This means that VS Code has recognized the extension we're developing.

  3. Choose "Extension Tests", and click the "run" icon â–¶
  4. A new VS Code window will pop up and run the tests.
    
- From command line

  ```
  cd cyberbrain-vsc && npm test
  ```

  This will open a new VS Code window and run the tests.
  
  Note that if you're using the latest version of VS Code, the test runner will complain that a VS Code window has already been opened. You can download and use the [Insiders version](https://code.visualstudio.com/insiders/) for development to solve this issue.
  
## Run the extension under development

Click "Run Extension"

Then open a file under the [`examples/`](https://github.com/laike9m/Cyberbrain/tree/master/examples) folder, [run it](https://github.com/laike9m/Cyberbrain#how-to-use) like you would normally do.

## Code Style

We use 
- [black](https://github.com/psf/black) for Python formatting.
- [prettier-eslint-cli](https://github.com/prettier/prettier-eslint-cli) for TypeScript/JavaScript formatting.

You should be able to find the corresponding plugins that do auto-formatting for your editor or IDE of choose.

- If you're using VS Code:
  - The official [Python plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python) lets you set black as the formatter.
  - [Prettier ESLint
](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rvest.vs-code-prettier-eslint)
- If you're using JetBrains' IDEs, there might be other ways, but I tend to use [File Watchers](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/using-file-watchers.html):

Code style will be checked for any PR, so make sure to get them right before filing a PR.

## Packaging

```
make publish
```

This is just FYI. As of now only me have the permission to publish new versions.
