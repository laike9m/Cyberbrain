## Status Quo and Milestones

*Updated 2020.9*

Cyberbrain is still under active development. Milestones for the project are listed below, which may change in the future. Generally speaking, we'll release 1.0 when it reaches the *"Production ready"* milestone.

| Milestone        | Description                                                           | Status |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|
| Examples ready   | Cyberbrain works on certain examples (in the `examples/` folder)      | [ ]    |
| Live demo ready  | Cyberbrain can work with code you write in a live demo, in most cases | [ ]    |
| Script ready     | Cyberbrain can work with most "scripts" programs                      | [ ]    |
| Production ready | Cyberbrain can work with most programs in production                  | [ ]    |

Note that v1.0 means Cyberbrain is stable in the features it supports, it does **NOT** mean Cyberbrain is feature complete. Major features planned for each version are listed below. Again, expect it to change at any time.

| Version | Features                        |
|---------|---------------------------------|
| 1.0     | Multi-frame tracing             |
| 2.0     | Fine-grained symbol tracing     |
| 3.0     | Async & multi-threading support |
