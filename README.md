# Cyberbrain: Python debugging, **redefined**.

Cyberbrain is a Python debugging solution aiming to **free programmers**.

## Install

Cyberbrain consists of a Python library and various editor/IDE integrations. Currently VS Code is the only supported editor.

TODO

Can Cyberbrain work with other IDEs and editors? See our [plan](https://github.com/laike9m/Cyberbrain/issues/24).

## Status Quo and Milestones

*Updated 2020.9*

Cyberbrain is still under active development. Milestones for the project are listed below, which may change over time. Generally speaking, we'll release 1.0 when it reaches  "*Production ready*".

| Milestone        | Description                                                           | Status |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|
| Examples ready   | Cyberbrain works on certain examples (in the `examples/` folder)      | WIP    |
| Live demo ready  | Cyberbrain can work with code you write in a live demo, in most cases | Not started    |
| Scripts ready     | Cyberbrain can work with most "scripting" programs                      | Not started    |
| Announcement ready | Cyberbrain is ready to be shared on Hacker News and Reddit. **Please don't broadcast Cyberbrain before it reaches this milestone.**                  | Not started    |
| Production ready | Cyberbrain can work with most programs in production                  | Not started    |

Note that v1.0 means Cyberbrain is stable in the features it supports, it does **NOT** mean Cyberbrain is feature complete. Major features planned for each version are listed below. Again, expect it to change at any time.

| Version | Features                        |
|---------|---------------------------------|
| 1.0     | Mutual interaction between source code and the trace graph ([#7][m1])  |
| 2.0     | Multi-frame tracing             |
| 3.0     | Fine-grained symbol tracing     |
| 4.0     | Async & multi-threading support |
