What is a knot?
A knot represents a loop. To be more specific, it is the place where a loop starts.
When one iteration ends, the program will jump back to the code location that a knot
represents.

We use knots to record loop starts, but we don't record where a loop ends. Reasons are:
1. It's unnecessary, we know an iteration ends if the program jumps back to a knot.
2. Different iterations of the same loop can exit at different positions (e.g. continue)

Usually, knots have the same offset with FOR_ITER instructions, but since FOR_ITER does
not lead to any events, knots is "placed" right before the first event in the loop, and we
store the index of the first loop event in each iterations. Later when updating nodes,
we can just traverse from the firstLoopEventIndex corresponding to the current loop counter.
