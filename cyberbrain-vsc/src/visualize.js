/*
If you want to modify this file, you may find it hard because the vis-network lib
is not imported directly, so you won't have auto-complete. Due to the limitation
 of vscode,
(https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/72900#issuecomment-487140263)
it's impossible to import a file, as it requires sending http requests.

So I pretty much just rely on my IDE (PyCharm in this case) to provide the
definitions for me. In "Languages & Frameworks > JavaScript > Libraries", you
can add the local vis-network.js file as a library, so that PyCharm recognizes
the vis object, and can provide auto-complete. See
https://i.loli.net/2020/08/05/FBqXQpjk4YVLGRa.png

For other IDEs/editors, I believe it's possible to achieve a similar effect.
