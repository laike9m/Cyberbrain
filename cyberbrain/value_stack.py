        """Change the behavior of LOAD_ATTR.

        The effect of LOAD_ATTR is: Replaces TOS with getattr(TOS, co_names[namei]).
        However, this will make backtracing hard, because it eliminates the information
        about the source object, where the attribute originates from.

        Example: a = b.x
              0 LOAD_NAME                0 (b)
              2 LOAD_ATTR                1 (x)
              4 STORE_NAME               2 (a)
              6 LOAD_CONST               0 (None)
              8 RETURN_VALUE

        Tos was 'b' (in our customized version of LOAD_NAME), then LOAD_ATTR replaces it
        with the value of `b.x`. This caused 'a' to lost from the value stack, but we
        need it to know that b caused a to change.

        Example: a.x.y = 1
              0 LOAD_CONST               0 (1)
              2 LOAD_NAME                0 (a)
              4 LOAD_ATTR                1 (x)
              6 STORE_ATTR               2 (y)
              8 LOAD_CONST               1 (None)
             10 RETURN_VALUE

        Tos was 'a', then LOAD_ATTR replaces it with the value of `a.x`. This caused 'a'
        to lost from the value stack, but we need it to know that a's value has changed.

        In both examples, we can see what the value of the attribute doesn't mean much
        to us, so it's fine if we don't store it. But the "name" of the source object is
        vital, so we need to keep it. Thus, the handler just does nothing.
